 ## Description
This API is designed for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friends list. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the technologies and functionalities involved:

 Social-Network is the seven-tenth challenge for the Ohio State coding boot camp.
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding backend with JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDb, Mongoose, Insomnia, Moment.js.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying for the 17 weeks. 
-	This page was a perfect example of real-world practices and how to write backend code. 
-	I learned how to code and test routes for a backend Social-Network.  

 ## User Story
- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Technologies 
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
    - Routing: Express.js handles the routing for our API, directing HTTP requests to the appropriate handlers.
    - Middleware: Utilizes middleware for parsing JSON, handling errors, and managing sessions/authentication.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
   - Database: MongoDB serves as the database, storing information about users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.
   -  NoSQL Database: Allows for flexible and scalable storage of JSON-like documents.

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
   - Object Data Modeling (ODM): Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model our application    data.
   - Schema Definitions: Defines schemas for users, thoughts, and reactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
   -  Validation and Middleware: Offers built-in validation and middleware support to enforce rules and perform actions before or after saving data.

[Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)
   - Timestamp Formatting: Moment.js is used to format timestamps, providing readable and consistent date and time    formatting across the application.
   - Date Manipulation: Simplifies date manipulation and formatting, making it easier to display human-readable timestamps.

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
   - API Testing: Insomnia is utilized to test API endpoints and ensure they work correctly.
   - Seed Data Creation: Facilitates the creation of seed data by sending HTTP requests to populate the database with initial data for testing and development.

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Tests
Insomnia plays a crucial role in managing the user database for our social network web application. It is utilized for various operations, including adding, updating, and removing entities within the database. Here’s a breakdown of how Insomnia is employed:

   **USER**
   - Create a new user: `POST /api/users`
   - Get all users: `GET /api/users`
   - Get a single user by its `id`: `GET /api/users/:userId`
   - Update a user by its `id`: `PUT /api/users/:userId`
   - Delete a user by its `id`: `DELETE /api/user/:userId`

   **THOUGHT**
   - Create a new thought: `POST /api/thoughts/`
   - Get all thoughts: `GET /api/thoughts/`
   - Get a single thought by its `id`: `GET /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
   - Update a thought by its `id`: `PUT /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
   - Delete a thought by its `id`: `DELETE /api/thoughts/:thoughtId`

   **REACTION**
   - Create a reaction: `POST /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`
   - Delete a reaction by the `reactionId`: `DEL /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId`
